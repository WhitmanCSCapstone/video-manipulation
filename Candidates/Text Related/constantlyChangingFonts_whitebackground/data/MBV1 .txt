My Bloody Valentine 
Isn't Anything 
Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside) 
Soft as snow but warm inside Penetrate you cannot hide Feeling lost forever Really need you Feeling dark and feeling true This is all I ever knew Soft as skin in leather And I whisper 'you' Harder you come down on me Sink away you look happily Secrets keep forever They're undressing me Come inside it's warm in here Better now to have no fear Carried on a wave (Where it can lead) you Touch your head, then your hair Softer, softer everywhere Fingertips are burning Can I touch you there Soft as velvet eyes can see Bring me close to ecstacy High away to heaven And I'm coming too Float now coming down on me Handed you what I cannot see Feel the big happy, you're exploding me 
Soft as snow and warm inside Penetrate then redivide Slip away forever (Do we) need you 
Lose My Breath 
Keep coming now Possessed of nothing more than hell Before I can speak My world is wishing me asleep 
Weigh me down And when the darkness comes around Repeating heads Remember nothing I have said Where are you Come back again I want you to 'Not now girl' you say But I was born to lose my breath 
Cupid Come 
Cupid come from coffee cup Sickly heavy heart Semi-set adrift in your Lifted sugar eye Come back down I'm waiting here And lick me with your fire Connected silver tounges Our lips beside Everytime I look at you Pins me to the ground Mirror me your memories please And let me help you down Swallow me into your bed With glimpses of your thighs Forget your vanity Come cupid come 
(When You Wake) You're Still In A Dream 
Turn around to watch all the same You know (you're) simply a game I see you've messed up your laughing head I'll take you again and again 
When you wake you're still in a dream Not real though I love you unclean I'm telling you you're a sick mind You come back so fine, so fine 
Know your smile is colder than ice That will back you up real nice But killing's hardly a weapon for you Your wasted space is mine to 
No More Sorry 
What happened then And again And then again And again Loved me black and blue No more sorry 
Flesh and bone Not alone You're not alone Waiting by the telephone Whatever you do Don't call daddy In my head And everywhere And everywhere And everywhere Fingerprints of you Filthy daddy 
Wash and mend And wash and mend Some kind of friend You septic heart and deadly hand Loved me black and blue No more sorry 
All I Need 
You don't ask what I needed to do When I come back you'll need to choose Oh, whatever I ask you take take take take Oh, this is all I need to say 
It's in your eye, I wondered why No need to say (how close) can we lie Oh, we don't talk, you know all I need Oh, this is what I need to take 
You don't ask what I needed to do When I come back you'll need to choose Oh, all I ask you do do do do Oo, this is all I need from you 
Feed Me With Your Kiss 
Yeah, (can you get) what you see But you can't have what you can't 
Hey, what's come down over me It's the way you stood 
'Cause things the way they are I guess you might go real far So feed me with your kiss 
Oh, come lie down close to me Do what you dare Oh I don't care I will get what I can see I'll crawl over there 
(Spread me like a) (appeal to you) I do what I do I do what I will do 
Crave, your kiss will set you free I'll do what I should 
Sueisfine 
I will don't leave Me here alone, oh Sueisfine/Suicide Hold hold hold me Talk a lot don't brood again Sueisfine/Suicide Give me (fuck cunt) Now you'll taste so good Sueisfine/Suicide 
Several Girls Galore 
Heard (that I met me) once before Was it me or just don't (you care) Once more ignore As I wrap me around we I'm never quite there at all 
So which me should I put on To go out driving in my car Feeling so sore I took me out dancing Three of me or more Insane I'm sure That living inside me Are several girls galore 
Once more ignore I'll wrap me around we I'm never quite there at all 
Insane I'm sure We're living inside me Several girls galore 
You Never Should 
Twisting round inside My heart is burning up, my head divide But you control these feelings I can't hide Tried to change my mind (Until) the end there's nothing in control of you It isn't easy but that's all I can do 
Oh, you took a long time Yeah, 'cause you probably could Oo, you said the fault was mine Yeah, but you never should 
Breaking down again You're running little circles through your hair I could walk away now and you wouldn't care Don't look so surprised You crawl around and then you seem to wonder why I turn around and see madness in your eyes 
Nothing Much To Lose 
Your soft hand But I don't understand Your big brown eyes With a small small heart 
I'll come down, down, down Oh, you don't know what you found Don't, don't walk walk walk away 
Take me I will remember you Long dark hair Nothing much to lose 
Help you crawl crawl crawl Oh, I wanna see it all Eyes asked why why why, too late 
I Can See It (But I Can't Feel It) 
Don't know when I will leave you again Grab a reason And I'm dragging you down Come just to make you happy Shot in the head I can see I can see it But I can't feel it
