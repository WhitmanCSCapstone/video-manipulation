We, the Global Studies Steering Committee, regret to inform you that after seven years of successful faculty development, student-focused programming, and contributions to faculty recruitment, retention, and diversity, the Provost and Dean of Faculty Patrick Spencer has unilaterally, and without consulting the Steering Committee or Global Studies Director, suspended the Global Studies Initiative for the 2016-2017 academic year.
