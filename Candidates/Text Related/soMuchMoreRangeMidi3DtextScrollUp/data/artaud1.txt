I learned yesterday 
(I must be behind the times, or perhaps it's only a false rumor, 
one of those pieces of spiteful gossip that are circulated between 
sink and latrine at the hour when meals that have been ingurgitated 
one more time are thrown in the slop buckets), 
I learned yesterday 
one of the most sensational of those official practices of American 
public schools 
which no doubt account for the fact that this country believes itself 
to be in the vanguard of progress, 
It seems that, among the examinations or tests required of a child 
entering public school for the first time, there is the so-called 
seminal fluid or sperm test, 
which consists of asking this newly entering child for a small 
amount of his sperm so it can be placed in a jar 
and kept ready for any attempts at artificial insemination that 
might later take place. 
For Americans are finding more and more that they lack muscle 
and children, 
that is, not workers 
but soldiers, 
and they want at all costs and by every possible means to make 
and manufacture soldiers 
with a view to all the planetary wars which might later take place, 
and which would be intended to demonstrate by the overwhelming 
virtues of force 
the superiority of American products, 
and the fruits of American sweat in all fields of activity and of the 
superiority of the possible dynamism of force. 
Because one must produce, 
one must by all possible means of activity replace nature 
wherever it can be replaced, 
one must find a major field of action for human inertia, 
the worker must have something to keep him busy, 
new fields of activity must be created, 
in which we shall see at last the reign of all the fake manufactured 
products, 
of all the vile synthetic substitutes 
in which beatiful real nature has no part, 
and must give way finally and shamefully before all the victorious 
substitute products 
in which the sperm of all artificial insemination factories 
will make a miracle 
in order to produce armies and battleships. 
No more fruit, no more trees, no more vegetables, no more plants 
pharmaceutical or otherwise and consequently no more food, 
but synthetic products to satiety, 
amid the fumes, 
amid the special humors of the atmosphere, on the particular axes 
of atmospheres wrenched violently and synthetically from the 
resistances of a nature which has known nothing of war except 
fear. 
And war is wonderful, isn't it? 
For it's war, isn't it, that the Americans have been preparing for 
and are preparing for this way step by step. 
In order to defend this senseless manufacture from all competition 
that could not fail to arise on all sides, 
one must have soldiers, armies, airplanes, battleships, 
hence this sperm 
which it seems the governments of America have had the effrontery 
to think of. 
For we have more than one enemy 
lying in wait for us, my son, 
we, the born capitalists, 
and among these enemies 
Stalin's Russia 
which also doesn't lack armed men. 
All this is very well, 
but I didn't know the Americans were such a warlike people. 
In order to fight one must get shot at 
and although I have seen many Americans at war 
they always had huge armies of tanks, airplanes, battleships 
that served as their shield. 
I have seen machines fighting a lot 
but only infinitely far 
behind 
them have I seen the men who directed them. 
Rather than people who feed their horses, cattle, and mules the 
last tons of real morphine they have left and replace it with 
substitutes made of smoke, 
I prefer the people who eat off the bare earth the delirium from 
which they were born 
I mean the Tarahumara 
eating Peyote off the ground 
while they are born, 
and who kill the sun to establish the kingdom of black night, 
and who smash the cross so that the spaces of spaces can never 
again meet and cross. 
And so you are going to hear the dance of TUTUGURI. 
TUTUGURI 
The Rite of the Black Sun 
And below, as if at the foot of the bitter slope, 
cruelly despairing at the heart, 
gapes the circle of the six crosses, 
very low 
as if embedded in the mother earth, 
wrenched from the foul embrace of the mother 
who drools. 
The earth of black coal 
is the only damp place 
in this cleft rock. 
The Rite is that the new sun passes through seven points before 
blazing on the orifice of the earth. 
And there are six men, 
one for each sun, 
and a seventh man 
who is the sun 
in the raw 
dressed in black and in red flesh. 
But, this seventh man 
is a horse, 
a horse with a man leading him. 
But it is the horse 
who is the sun 
and not the man. 
At the anguish of a drum and a long trumpet, 
strange, 
the six men 
who were lying down, 
rolling level with the ground, 
leap up one by one like sunflowers, 
not like suns 
but turning earths, 
water lilies, 
and each leap 
corresponds to the increasingly somber 
and restrained 
gong of the drum 
until suddenly he comes galloping, at vertiginous speed, 
the last sun, 
the first man, 
the black horse with a 
naked man, 
absolutely naked 
and virgin 
riding it. 
After they leap up, they advance in winding circles 
and the horse of bleeding meat rears 
and prances without a stop 
on the crest of his rock 
until the six men 
have surrounded 
completely 
the six crosses. 
Now, the essence of the Rite is precisely 
THE ABOLITION OF THE CROSS. 
When they have stopped turning 
they uproot 
the crosses of earth 
and the naked man 
on the horse 
holds up 
an enormous horseshoe 
which he has dipped in a gash of his blood. 
The Pursuit of Fecality 
There where it smells of shit 
it smells of being. 
Man could just as well not have shat, 
not have opened the anal pouch, 
but he chose to shit 
as he would have chosen to live 
instead of consenting to live dead. 
Because in order not to make caca, 
he would have had to consent 
not to be, 
but he could not make up his mind to lose 
being, 
that is, to die alive. 
There is in being 
something particularly tempting for man 
and this something is none other than 
CACA. 
(Roaring here.) 
To exist one need only let oneself be, 
but to live, 
one must be someone, 
to be someone, 
one must have a BONE, 
not be afraid to show the bone, 
and to lose the meat in the process. 
Man has always preferred meat 
to the earth of bones. 
Because there was only earth and wood of bone, 
and he had to earn his meat, 
there was only iron and fire 
and no shit, 
and man was afraid of losing shit 
or rather he desired shit 
and, for this, sacrificed blood. 
In order to have shit, 
that is, meat, 
where there was only blood 
and a junkyard of bones 
and where there was no being to win 
but where there was only life to lose.

At this point, man withdrew and fled. 
Then the animals ate him. 
It was not a rape, 
he lent himself to the obscene meal. 
He relished it, 
he learned himself 
to act like an animal 
and to eat rat 
daintily. 
And where does this foul debasement come from? 
The fact that the world is not yet formed, 
or that man has only a small idea of the world 
and wants to hold on to it forever? 
This comes from the fact that man, 
one fine day, 
stopped 
the idea of the world. 
Two paths were open to him: 
that of the infinite without, 
that of the infinitesimal within. 
And he chose the infinitesimal within. 
Where one need only squeeze 
the spleen, 
the tongue, 
the anus 
or the glans. 
And god, god himself squeezed the movement. 
Is God a being? 
If he is one, he is shit. 
If he is not one 
he does not exist. 
But he does not exist, 
except as the void that approaches with all its forms 
whose most perfect image 
is the advance of an incalculable group of crab lice. 
"You are mad Mr. Artaud, what about the mass?" 
I deny baptism and the mass. 
There is no human act, 
on the internal erotic level, 
more pernicious than the descent 
of the so-called jesus-christ 
onto the altars. 
No one will believe me 
and I can see the public shrugging its shoulders 
but the so-called christ is none other than he 
who in the presence of the crab louse god 
consented to live without a body, 
while an army of men 
descended from a cross, 
to which god thought he had long since nailed them, 
has revolted, 
and, armed with steel, 
with blood, 
with fire, and with bones, 
advances, reviling the Invisible 
to have done with GOD'S JUDGMENT. 
The Question Arises ... 
What makes it serious 
is that we know 
that after the order 
of this world 
there is another. 
What is it like? 
We do not know. 
The number and order of possible suppositions in 
this realm 
is precisely 
infinity! 
And what is infinity? 
That is precisely what we do not know! 
It is a word 
that we use 
to indicate 
the opening 
of our consciousness 
toward possibility 
beyond measure, 
tireless and beyond measure. 
And precisely what is consciousness? 
That is precisely what we do not know. 
It is nothingness. 
A nothingness 
that we use 
to indicate 
when we do not know something 
from what side 
we do not know it 
and so 
we say 
consciousness, 
from the side of consciousness, 
but there are a hundred thousand other sides. 
Well? 
It seems that consciousness 
in us is 
linked 
to sexual desire 
and to hunger; 
but it could 
just as well 
not be linked 
to them. 
One says, 
one can say, 
there are those who say 
that consciousness 
is an appetite, 
the appetite for living; 
and immediately 
alongside the appetite for living, 
it is the appetite for food 
that comes immediately to mind; 
as if there were not people who eat 
without any sort of appetite; 
and who are hungry. 
For this too 
exists 
to be hungry 
without appetite; 
well? 
Well 
the space of possibility 
was given to me one day 
like a loud fart 
that I will make; 
but neither of space, 
nor possibility, 
did I know precisely what it was, 
and I did not feel the need to think about it, 
they were words 
invented to define things 
that existed 
or did not exist 
in the face of 
the pressing urgency 
of a need: 
the need to abolish the idea, 
the idea and its myth, 
and to enthrone in its place 
the thundering manifestation 
of this explosive necessity: 
to dilate the body of my internal night, 
the internal nothingness 
of my self 
which is night, 
nothingness, 
thoughtlessness, 
but which is explosive affirmation 
that there is 
something 
to make room for: 
my body. 
And truly 
must it be reduced to this stinking gas, 
my body? 
To say that I have a body 
because I have a stinking gas 
that forms 
inside me? 
I do not know 
but 
I do know that 
space, 
time, 
dimension, 
becoming, 
future, 
destiny, 
being, 
non-being, 
self, 
non-self, 
are nothing to me; 
but there is a thing 
which is something, 
only one thing 
which is something, 
and which I feel 
because it wants 
TO GET OUT: 
the presence 
of my bodily 
suffering, 
the menacing, 
never tiring 
presence 
of my 
body; 
however hard people press me with questions 
and however vigorously I deny all questions, 
there is a point 
at which I find myself compelled 
to say no, 
NO 
then 
to negation; 
and this point 
comes when they press me, 
when they pressure me 
and when they handle me 
until the exit 
from me 
of nourishment, 
of my nourishment 
and its milk, 
and what remains? 
That I am suffocated; 
and I do not know if it is an action 
but in pressing me with questions this way 
until the absence 
and nothingness 
of the question 
they pressed me 
until the idea of body 
and the idea of being a body 
was suffocated 
in me, 
and it was then that I felt the obscene 
and that I farted 
from folly 
and from excess 
and from revolt 
at my suffocation. 
Because they were pressing me 
to my body 
and to the very body 
and it was then 
that I exploded everything 
because my body 
can never be touched. 
Conclusion 
- And what was the purpose of this broadcast, Mr. Artaud? 
- Primarily to denounce certain social obscenities officially sanctioned and acknowledged: 
this emission of infantile sperm donated by children for the artificial insemination of fetuses yet to be born and which will be born in a century or more. 
To denounce, in this same American people who occupy the whole surface of the former Indian continent, a rebirth of that warlike imperialism of early America that caused the pre-Columbian Indian tribes to be degraded by the aforesaid people. 
- You are saying some very bizarre things, Mr. Artaud. 
- Yes, I am saying something bizarre, that contrary to everything we have been led to believe, the pre-Columbian Indians were a strangely civilized people and that in fact they knew a form of civilization based exclusively on the principle of cruelty. 
- And do you know precisely what is meant by cruelty? 
- Offhand, no, I don't. 
- Cruelty means eradicating by means of blood and until blood flows, god, the bestial accident of unconscious human animality, wherever one can find it. 
- Man, when he is not restrained, is an erotic animal, 
he has in him an inspired shudder, 
a kind of pulsation 
that produces animals without number which are the form that the ancient tribes of the earth universally attributed to god. 
This created what is called a spirit. 
Well, this spirit originating with the American Indians is reappearing all over the world today under scientific poses which merely accentuate its morbid infectuous power, the marked condition of vice, but a vice that pullulates with diseases, 
because, laugh if you like, 
what has been called microbes 
is god, 
and do you know what the Americans and the Russians use to make their atoms? 
They make them with the microbes of god. 
- You are raving, Mr. Artaud. 
You are mad. 
- I am not raving. 
I am not mad. 
I tell you that they have reinvented microbes in order to impose a new idea of god. 
They have found a new way to bring out god and to capture him in his microbic noxiousness. 
This is to nail him though the heart, 
in the place where men love him best, 
under the guise of unhealthy sexuality, 
in that sinister appearance of morbid cruelty that he adopts 
whenever he is pleased to tetanize and madden humanity as he 
is doing now. 
He utilizes the spirit of purity and of a consciousness that has 
remained candid like mine to asphyxiate it with all the false 
appearances that he spreads universally through space and this 
is why Artaud le Mômo can be taken for a person suffering 
from hallucinations. 
- What do you mean, Mr. Artaud? 
- I mean that I have found the way to put an end to this ape once and for all 
and that although nobody believes in god any more everybody believes more and more in man. 
So it is man whom we must now make up our minds to emasculate. 
- How's that? 
How's that? 
No matter how one takes you you are mad, ready for the straitjacket. 
- By placing him again, for the last time, on the autopsy table to remake his anatomy. 
I say, to remake his anatomy. 
Man is sick because he is badly constructed. 
We must make up our minds to strip him bare in order to scrape off that animalcule that itches him mortally, 
god, 
and with god 
his organs. 
For you can tie me up if you wish, 
but there is nothing more useless than an organ. 
When you will have made him a body without organs, 
then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions 
and restored him to his true freedom. 
They you will teach him again to dance wrong side out 
as in the frenzy of dance halls 
and this wrong side out will be his real place.
