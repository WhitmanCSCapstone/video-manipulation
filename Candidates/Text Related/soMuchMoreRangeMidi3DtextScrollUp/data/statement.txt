My recent work comes from a daily practice of creating sketches using the programming language Processing and posting video excerpts of these sketches on Instagram. While the daily work has started to add up in terms of product I am most interested in the process. Every once in a while I end up with something well in excess of my daily one minute goal.  Most recently I’ve been interested in making sound reactive or midi controlled video effects, which manipulate screen captured footage of my browsing habits on the website Tumblr. I like to think of this as a form of Experimental, particularly Structural, Film.  As part of that same daily practice I compose improvisational sound compositions with cheap synthesizers, samplers, and sequencers such as the Teenage Engineering PO-35 Speak Pocket Operator. I am growing into that guy making weird noises in his basement. As such this is in some ways also a self-portrait, a collection of habits, with my body in absence.
